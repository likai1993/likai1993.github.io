* Fall 2022 - Now: **Blockchain-based Cybercrime Detection and Analysis**
  * This project aims to detect emerging cryptocurrency scams spread on online social networks and phishing attacks on blockchain platforms.
  * Publications: <span style="color:blue">[IEEE Blockchain 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10634), [ACM SIGMETRICS 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12306), [ACM CCS 2024]()</span>

* Fall 2019 - Now: **Blockchain System and Network Security**
  * This project focuses on discovering DoS attacks at different Ethereum network layers, including RPC service, P2P networks, and Mempool. Several zero-day DoS vulnerabilities have been discovered in different Ethereum clients, such as Geth, OpenEthereum, Besu, and Nethermind. The discovered vulnerabilities have been acknowledged and patched by the Ethereum developer community.
  * Assigned CVEs: <span style="color:blue">[CVE-2022-23327](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23327), [CVE-2022-23328](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23328)</span>

* Spring 2018 - Spring 2020: **Smart Sontract Cost Optimization**
  * This project strives to optimize transaction costs for blockchain users to use the Ethereum service. New middleware has been developed to save transaction costs at the smart contract storage layer and transaction layer, including dynamic data replication framework and transaction batching framework.

Research Projects
======
* Fall 2022 - Now: **Cryptocurrency Scam Detection**
  * This project aims to detect emerging cryptocurrency scams spread on social networks and blockchain platforms.
  * Publications: [IEEE Blockchain 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10634), [ACM SIGMETRICS 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12306).

* Fall 2019 - Now: **Ethereum System Security**
  * This project focuses on discovering DoS attacks at different Ethereum system layers, including RPC service, P2P networks, and Mempool. Several zero-day DoS vulnerabilities have been discovered in different Ethereum clients, including Geth, OpenEthereum, Besu, and Nethermind. The discovered vulnerabilities have been acknowledged and patched by the Ethereum developer community.
  * Assigned CVE: [CVE-2022-23327](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23327), [CVE-2022-23328](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23328)
  * Publications: <span style="color:blue">[ACM IMC 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3487552.3487814), [NDSS 2021](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/ndss2021_3C-1_23108_paper.pdf), [ACM CCS 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3460120.3485369)</span>

* Spring 2018 - Spring 2019: **Smart contract cost optimization and cloud storage inconsistency detection**
  * This project strives to optimize transaction costs for blockchain users to use the Ethereum service. New middleware has been developed to save transaction costs at the smart contract storage layer and transaction layer, including dynamic data replication framework and transaction batching framework.
  * Publications: <span style="color:blue">[ACM Middleware 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04078.pdf), [ESEC/FSE 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3468264.3468568)</span>

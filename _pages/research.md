Research Projects
======
* Fall 2022 - Now: **Cryptocurrency Scam Detection**
  * This project aims to detect emerging cryptocurrency scams spread on social networks and blockchain platforms.

* Spring 2021 - Now: **Ethereum Mempool Security**
  * This project focuses on discovering DoS attacks against the Ethereum memory pool. Several zero-day DoS attacks have been discovered on different Ethereum clients, including Geth, OpenEthereum, Besu, Nethermind. The discovered attacks affect real-world mining nodes and transaction relay services and have been patched by the Ethereum developer community.
 * Two CVEs assigned: CVE-2022-23327, CVE-2022-23328.

* Spring 2021 - Fall 2021: **Ethereum P2P Network Topology**
  * This project aims at uncovering real Ethereum P2P network topology. A novel technique, TopoShot, has been proposed and successfully uncovered the topology of Ethereum testnets and the sub-topology of Ethereum mainnet.

* Fall 2019 - Fall 2020: **Ethereum RPC Service Security**
  * This project focuses on examining the security of Ethereum RPC services. One zero-day DoS attack has been discovered and confirmed to affect real-world RPC services. A novel technique is developed to characterize the load-balancing policy deployed by real-world service. The vulnerability was disclosed to Ethereum and was fixed in Feb. 2021.

* Spring 2018 - Spring 2019: **Smart contract cost optimization and cloud storage inconsistency detection**
  * Devised a middleware that dynamically replicates data feeds between off-chain storage and on-chain smart contracts to save Gas costs.
  * Repurposed Blockchain's hardness to detect inconsistencies in cloud storage.

Education
======
* Ph.D. in ECE, Syracuse University, 2022
* B.Eng. in EE, NUAA, 2015

Research Experience
======
* Spring 2018 - Fall 2021: Research Assistant, Syracuse University
  * Discovered several vulnerabilities in Ethereum memory pool that leads to low-cost DoS attack against real-world miners and transaction relay services. **The vulnerability was revealed to the affected services and Ethereum Foundation and bug fixes are in progress**.
  * Identified several vulnerabilities in Ethereum RPC APIs that lead to low-cost DoS attack against real-world transaction relay services. A novel measurement method is proposed to uncover the load balance's policies adopted by these services which can reduce the cost of the DoS attack. **The vulnerability was released to the affected services and Ethereum Foundation and it has been fixed since Feb. 2021**.
  * Repurposing public Blockchain to detect the inconsistent activities of cloud storage. We proposed and implemented an storage consistency auditing protocol based on Bitcoin and Ethereum.
  * Hacking LLVM at the backend level (llc) to inject TSX features (e.g., xbegin, xend) when compiling X86 binaries, the purpose is to partition the program into multiple execution units secured by TSX and to mitigate side-channal attacks.

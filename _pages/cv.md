Research Projects
======
* Fall 2022 - Now: **Cryptocurrency Scam Detection**
  * Detecting emerging cryptocurrency scams spread on social networks.

* Spring 2021 - Fall 2022: **Ethereum Mempool Security**
  * Discovered several vulnerabilities in Ethereum memory pool that leads to low-cost DoS attack against real-world miners and transaction relay services. The vulnerability was disclosed with two CVEs assigned.

* Spring 2021 - Spring 2021: **Ethereum P2P Network Topology**
  * Devised a novel technique, TopoShot, for uncovering real Ethereum P2P network topology. 

* Fall 2019 - Fall 2020: **Ethereum RPC Service Security**
  * Discovered a zero-day DoS vulnerability in RPC API (eth_call) that causes DoERs attack and devised a novel technique to characterize real RPC service's load balancing policies. The vulnerability was disclosed and has been fixed by Feb. 2021.

* Spring 2018 - Spring 2019: **Smart contract cost optimization and cloud storage inconsistency detection**
  * Devised a middleware that can dynamically replicate data feeds between an off-chain storage and on-chain smart contract storage to save Gas cost on Ethereum.
  * Repurposed Blockchain's hardness to detect inconsistencies in cloud storage.

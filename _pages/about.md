About me
----
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science). Previously, I was an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at [San Diego State University](https://cs.sdsu.edu/). My research interests lie in distributed system security, cybercrime detection and prevention, performance analysis and optimization. I received my Ph.D. from [Syracuse University](http://eng-cs.syr.edu/our-departments/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science) in 2022, under the guidance of [Dr. Yuzhe (Richard) Tang](http://tristartom.github.io/). 

Currently, my research group focuses on understanding and hardening the security of largely deployed blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin at different system layers, detecting and flagging emerging cryptocurrency scams and phishing attacks, and optimizing the performance of blockchain's P2P network.

Student Opportunities
----
I am always looking for self-motivated students to work on system and network security. If you are interested, **please read our recent papers** before sending me an email with your CV and transcripts.

Short Bio
----
I am an Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Computer Science at San Diego State University [[SDSU]](https://cs.sdsu.edu/). My research interests lie in security evaluation, vulnerability detection, and performance optimization, with current focus on Blockchain. I received my Ph.D. from Syracuse University [[SU]](http://eng-cs.syr.edu/our-departments/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science) in 2022, where I was adviced by [Dr. Yuzhe (Richard) Tang](http://tristartom.github.io/). 

Currently, my research focuses on understanding and hardening the security of largely deployed Blockchain systems such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.

 **I am always looking for self-motivated students to work on system security. If you are interested, please send me an email with your CV and transcripts!**

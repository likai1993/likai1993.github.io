Short Bio
----
I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Computer Science at San Diego State University. My research interests lie in security evaluation, vulnerability detection, and performance optimization, with current focus on Blockchain. I received my Ph.D. from Syracuse University [[SU]](http://eng-cs.syr.edu/our-departments/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science) in 2022, under the guidence of [Dr. Yuzhe (Richard) Tang](http://tristartom.github.io/). I received my B.Eng from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautic [[NUAA]](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn) in 2015.

Currently, my research focuses on evaluating the security and mitigating vulnerability and implementation bugs in permissionless Blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. I have a solid understanding of Ethereum's codebase (e.g., Geth, Parity/OpenEthereum), with expertise in Ethereum's APIs, p2p protocol, memory pool and smart contracts.
